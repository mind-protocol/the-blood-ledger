# Graph Health — Sync: Current State

## CHAIN

```
PATTERNS:        ./PATTERNS_Graph_Health_Validation.md
THIS:            SYNC_Graph_Health.md
```

---

## MATURITY

**What's canonical (v1):**
- Schema-driven health check CLI (`check_health.py`).
- Schema validation test suite (`test_schema.py`).
- Curated query set with quality ratings (`example_queries.cypher`).

**What's still being designed:**
- How health checks integrate into CI or automated workflows.
- Whether link property validation needs deeper coverage.

**What's proposed (v2+):**
- Exportable reports (CSV/markdown) for audit trails.
- Automated repair suggestions or optional fix mode.

## CURRENT STATE

The graph health module provides a YAML-backed schema (`schema.yaml`), a CLI
health check that reports missing required fields and invalid enums, a pytest
suite for schema invariants, and a terminology linter for NPC/character naming.
Query artifacts include a rated Cypher library plus expected/actual outputs to
make inspection repeatable.

Repair issue #16 confirmed `check_health.py` already implements the health
report helpers; no code changes were required.

Re-verified during the 05-INCOMPLETE_IMPL-health-check_health repair pass;
the helpers remain implemented with no adjustments needed.

## IN PROGRESS

No active implementation work is underway for graph health; the current effort
is limited to documentation hygiene to align the SYNC template with required
sections and keep the status record complete and traceable.

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

No known functional defects are reported in the graph health tooling at this
time; any remaining concerns are limited to documentation completeness and
potential future CI integration decisions.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Your likely VIEW:** VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code

**Where I stopped:** Documented the graph health module and added a DOCS link.

**What you need to understand:**
Schema validation is centered on `schema.yaml`, with both CLI and pytest entry
points. The query library is a static asset meant for human use.

**Watch out for:**
Doc chain is minimal; add BEHAVIORS/ALGORITHM/VALIDATION/IMPLEMENTATION/TEST if
this module becomes a frequent touchpoint.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

No human decision is required for this repair; the update only fills missing
SYNC sections to satisfy the doc template drift check and does not alter code.

---

## TODO

### Tests to Run

```bash
python engine/graph/health/check_health.py --graph seed
pytest engine/graph/health/test_schema.py -v
python engine/graph/health/lint_terminology.py --graph seed
```

### Immediate

- [ ] Decide whether to add full doc chain (BEHAVIORS/ALGORITHM/etc.).

---

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

Focused on restoring template completeness with minimal edits; avoided altering
module intent and noted that this change is purely documentation alignment.

---

## POINTERS

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Health check CLI | `engine/graph/health/check_health.py` |
| Schema tests | `engine/graph/health/test_schema.py` |
| Terminology linter | `engine/graph/health/lint_terminology.py` |
| Schema definition | `engine/graph/health/schema.yaml` |
| Query library | `engine/graph/health/example_queries.cypher` |

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- Health report helpers are already implemented; incomplete-impl task was stale.
- Reconfirmed helper implementations; repair remains a documentation-only update.
- Expanded patterns doc to keep template coverage aligned with guidance.
- Verified issue #16 as a no-op for code; only SYNC updated.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Consider adding BEHAVIORS/ALGORITHM docs if this module changes again.

### Propositions
- None.
