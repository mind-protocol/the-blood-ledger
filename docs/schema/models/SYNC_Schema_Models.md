# Schema Models — Sync: Current State

```
LAST_UPDATED: 2025-12-19
UPDATED_BY: Codex (repair agent)
STATUS: DESIGNING
```

---

## MATURITY

**What's canonical (v1):**
- Pydantic models for nodes, links, and tensions in `engine/models/`.
- Enum taxonomy for schema fields in `engine/models/base.py`.

**What's still being designed:**
- Cross-model validation rules beyond field-level checks.

**What's proposed (v2+):**
- Dedicated schema validation suite that enforces graph-level invariants.

---

## CURRENT STATE

The engine exposes a unified set of Pydantic models for graph nodes, links, and
tensions, along with shared enums and helper methods. The module is structured
by responsibility (base enums, nodes, links, tensions) and re-exported from
`engine/models/__init__.py` for stable imports. Tests live in
`engine/tests/test_models.py` with some integration coverage in scenario tests.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-19: Documented schema models module

- **What:** Added module docs and mapping for `engine/models/**`.
- **Why:** Close undocumented module gap and enable `ngram` context navigation.
- **Files:** `docs/schema/models/PATTERNS_Pydantic_Schema_Models.md`, `docs/schema/models/SYNC_Schema_Models.md`, `engine/models/__init__.py`, `modules.yaml`.
- **Struggles/Insights:** Minimal chain created to avoid duplicating existing schema docs.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Your likely VIEW:** VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code

**Where I stopped:** Added docs + mapping; no code changes beyond DOCS reference.

**What you need to understand:**
Schema models are the canonical Pydantic types for nodes/links/tensions. Keep
`engine/models/__init__.py` as the public entry point and update docs if fields
change.

**Watch out for:**
Some schema behavior is documented in `docs/schema/SCHEMA.md` but not yet linked
into a full doc chain for this module.

## TODO

### Doc/Impl Drift

- [ ] IMPL->DOCS: If model fields change, update `docs/schema/models/`.

### Tests to Run

```bash
pytest engine/tests/test_models.py
```
