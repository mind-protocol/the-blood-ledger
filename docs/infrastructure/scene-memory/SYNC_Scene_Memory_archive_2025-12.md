## Maturity

STATUS: DEPRECATED

What's canonical (v1):
- The authoritative scene-memory state lives in `docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/SYNC_Scene_Memory.md` and the Moment Graph docs; this archive is only for historical reference.

What's still being designed:
- Active design work is tracked in the current SYNC and Moment Graph chains, not in this archived snapshot.

What's proposed (v2):
- Any future improvements should be documented in the live SYNC and only captured here if a new archive snapshot is produced.

---

## CURRENT STATE

This archive preserves the prior scene-memory SYNC snapshot, including the moment node type and moment processor API summary, while current status remains in the live SYNC file.

---

## IN PROGRESS

No active work is tracked in this archive; ongoing tasks should be recorded in `docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/SYNC_Scene_Memory.md` instead.

---

## RECENT CHANGES

2025-12-19: Added missing SYNC template sections to this archive so drift checks can recognize the standard headings for repair #16, without altering the historical content below.

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

No archive-specific issues are known; if any details appear stale or inconsistent, defer to the current scene-memory SYNC and Moment Graph documentation.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

Use the live SYNC at `docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/SYNC_Scene_Memory.md` for current work; this file is read-only history unless a new archival snapshot is created.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

This archive is retained to preserve prior decision history, but the canonical scene-memory state and open questions are tracked in the current SYNC and Moment Graph docs.

---

## TODO

- [ ] If this archive is refreshed again, re-run the SYNC template checklist to ensure maturity, handoff, and pointers remain aligned with protocol requirements.

---

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

Keeping the archive template-complete makes it easy to separate historical context from live obligations without re-reading the full current SYNC each time.

---

## POINTERS

- Current scene-memory state: `docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/SYNC_Scene_Memory.md`
- Scene-memory implementation: `docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/IMPLEMENTATION_Scene_Memory.md`
- Canonical Moment Graph docs: `docs/engine/moments/`

## MOMENT NODE TYPE
===============================================================================

From `engine/models/nodes.py`:

```python
class Moment:
    id: str           # {place}_{day}_{time}_{type}_{timestamp}
    text: str         # Actual content
    type: MomentType  # dialogue, narration, player_*, hint

    # Moment Graph fields
    status: MomentStatus   # possible, active, spoken, dormant, decayed
    weight: float          # 0-1, salience/importance
    tone: Optional[str]    # bitter, hopeful, urgent, etc.

    # Tick tracking
    tick_created: int
    tick_spoken: Optional[int]
    tick_decayed: Optional[int]

    # Transcript reference
    line: Optional[int]    # Line in transcript.json

    embedding: Optional[List[float]]
```

===============================================================================

## MOMENT PROCESSOR API
===============================================================================

`engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`:

```python
processor = MomentProcessor(graph_ops, embed_fn, playthrough_id)
processor.set_context(tick, place_id)

# Immediate moments (added to transcript)
processor.process_dialogue(text, speaker, name?, tone?)
processor.process_narration(text, name?, tone?)
processor.process_player_action(text, player_id, action_type)
processor.process_hint(text, name?, tone?)

# Potential moments (graph only)
processor.create_possible_moment(text, speaker_id, ...)

# Links
processor.link_moments(from_id, to_id, trigger, require_words?, ...)
processor.link_narrative_to_moments(narrative_id, moment_ids)
```

===============================================================================

## CHANGELOG
===============================================================================

### 2025-12-19
- Verified repair 03-INCOMPLETE_IMPL-memory-moment_processor; implementations
  already present, no code changes required.
- Rechecked `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py` for incomplete
  implementations; confirmed all flagged functions are implemented.
- Noted that the repair task flagged `moment_processor.py` functions as incomplete,
  but implementations already exist; no code changes required.
- Re-validated the moment processor repair task; implementations remain intact.
- Reconfirmed `_write_transcript`, `last_moment_id`, `transcript_line_count`,
  and `get_moment_processor` are implemented; no code changes required.
- **MAJOR UPDATE:** Refreshed SYNC to reflect Moment Graph architecture
- Original Scene-based design was superseded
- Documented all implemented components with file locations
- Updated status from DRAFT to CANONICAL
- Marked related docs as Superseded pending review

### 2024-12-16
- Initial documentation created (Scene-based design)
- PATTERN, BEHAVIOR, ALGORITHM, VALIDATION docs written
- Removed `about` attribute from Narrative (use links instead)
- Renamed `detail_embedding` to `embedding` for consistency
- Added Moment as first-class node type
- Changed from `sources: []` array to `FROM` links
- Added SAID links for dialogue attribution
- Added THEN links for moment sequencing

## RECENT CHANGES
===============================================================================

### 2025-12-19: Refreshed scene-memory implementation file metadata
- **What:** Updated the implementation doc line counts to match the current
  `engine/infrastructure/memory/__init__.py` and
  `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py` sizes.
- **Why:** Keep the file responsibility table and extraction candidate sizing
  aligned with the actual codebase layout.
- **Files:** `docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/IMPLEMENTATION_Scene_Memory.md`

### 2025-12-19: Clarified extraction candidates to avoid stale file references
- **What:** Reworded extraction target descriptions to emphasize they remain
  internal helpers within `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`.
- **Why:** Keep the implementation doc aligned with existing files while
  avoiding references to nonexistent modules.
- **Files:** `docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/IMPLEMENTATION_Scene_Memory.md`

### 2025-12-19: Normalized code structure paths in implementation doc
- **What:** Rewrote the code structure tree to use full file paths.
- **Why:** Prevent bare filename references from being flagged as broken links.
- **Files:** `docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/IMPLEMENTATION_Scene_Memory.md`

### 2025-12-19: Fixed broken implementation doc references
- **What:** Replaced method/attribute-only references with concrete file paths
  and line anchors, and removed non-existent extraction target paths from the
  implementation doc.
- **Why:** Clear broken-link checks for the scene-memory implementation doc.
- **Files:** `docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/IMPLEMENTATION_Scene_Memory.md`

### 2025-12-19: Updated scene-memory test path in modules.yaml
- **What:** Switched the scene-memory `tests` entry from a glob to the concrete
  file `engine/tests/test_moment.py`.
- **Why:** `ngram validate` treats glob strings as literal paths; pointing to an
  existing test file avoids YAML drift.
- **Files:** `modules.yaml`

### 2025-12-19: Rechecked moment processor helpers for current repair run
- **What:** Confirmed `_write_transcript`, `last_moment_id`,
  `transcript_line_count`, and `get_moment_processor` are already implemented in
  `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`.
- **Why:** The INCOMPLETE_IMPL alert remains stale; no code changes required.
- **Files:** `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`

### 2025-12-19: Logged moment processor helper verification for repair 02
- **What:** Verified the helper implementations flagged by the repair task remain
  complete (`_write_transcript`, `last_moment_id`, `transcript_line_count`,
  `get_moment_processor`).
- **Why:** This repair run confirms the INCOMPLETE_IMPL alert is stale.
- **Files:** `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`

### 2025-12-19: Rechecked moment processor helper implementations for current repair run
- **What:** Confirmed `_write_transcript`, `last_moment_id`, `transcript_line_count`,
  and `get_moment_processor` are already implemented in
  `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`.
- **Why:** The INCOMPLETE_IMPL alert is stale for this repair task.
- **Files:** `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`

### 2025-12-19: Revalidated moment processor helpers for current repair run
- **What:** Rechecked `_write_transcript`, `last_moment_id`,
  `transcript_line_count`, and `get_moment_processor`; all implementations
  remain present.
- **Why:** Confirm the INCOMPLETE_IMPL alert is stale for this repair task.
- **Files:** `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`

### 2025-12-19: Reconfirmed moment processor implementations
- **What:** Rechecked the helper implementations flagged by the repair task;
  no missing bodies were found.
- **Why:** This repair run validates the INCOMPLETE_IMPL alert is stale.
- **Files:** `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`

### 2025-12-19: Reverified moment processor helpers for repair 03
- **What:** Checked `_write_transcript`, `last_moment_id`,
  `transcript_line_count`, and `get_moment_processor` in
  `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`; all implementations are
  present.
- **Why:** Confirm the INCOMPLETE_IMPL report is stale.
- **Files:** `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`

### 2025-12-19: Reconfirmed moment processor implementations for repair 02
- **What:** Rechecked the same helper implementations flagged in this repair run;
  no empty bodies were found.
- **Why:** Validate the INCOMPLETE_IMPL alert remains stale.
- **Files:** `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`

### 2025-12-19: Added DOCS references for memory module entry points
- **What:** Added `# DOCS: docs/infrastructure/scene-memory/` to
  `engine/infrastructure/memory/__init__.py` and standardized the comment in
  `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`.
- **Why:** Ensure `ngram` doc mapping resolves both files in the module.
- **Files:** `engine/infrastructure/memory/__init__.py`,
  `engine/infrastructure/memory/moment_processor.py`
