## THE PROBLEM

Travel currently feels like a blocking orchestration step: a single process
owns all state, the frontend waits for a response, and the system has no
coherent way to surface mid-journey events or player interruptions.

---

## THE PATTERN

Shift coordination to the graph and use asynchronous hooks for interruptions:
Runner writes state, Frontend reacts via SSE, Narrator streams immediately, and
hooks handle only urgent player or character interrupts.

---

## PRINCIPLES

- Graph is the single source of truth, not a cache or secondary mirror.
- Runner completion is read via TaskOutput, not hook injection.
- Hooks signal interruptions only; everything else is regular data flow.
- Streaming UX is primary: narration starts before background work finishes.
- Travel is gameplay, so world generation must be visible and continuous.

---

## DEPENDENCIES

- FalkorDB graph store and GraphOps/GraphQueries APIs (ngram repo graph runtime).
- SSE or equivalent stream transport between graph writes and frontend.
- Background task execution for Runner with TaskOutput access.
- Injection queue file I/O used by hook scripts and UI actions.

---

## INSPIRATIONS

- Live-world sandboxes where travel reveals content in real time.
- Event-sourced systems that push updates instead of polling.
- Narrative engines that treat interruptions as explicit signals.

---

## SCOPE

This pattern applies to travel and asynchronous world simulation where
frontends must stay responsive while the graph evolves in the background.

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

- Define reconnection semantics for SSE and injection queue replay.
- Decide how Runner failures surface without reintroducing orchestration.
- Clarify how multiple concurrent Runners avoid conflicting writes.

---

## Core Principle

**Travel is not a loading screen. Travel is play.**

The world materializes as you move through it. No skeleton. No pre-authored waypoints. The Runner writes places to the graph as it computes the journey. The Frontend sees them appear via SSE. Images generate automatically.

---

## The Architecture in One Sentence

> **Graph is truth. Runner writes. TaskOutput returns. Hook interrupts.**

---

## Component Responsibilities

### Graph — Source of Truth

The graph is not a passive database. It is the orchestrator.

- Stores all state (places, characters, narratives, tensions, energy)
- Emits SSE events on every write
- Triggers image generation when places are created
- Writes to injection queue when characters are activated

**What it is NOT:**
- Managed by an external orchestrator process
- Polled for changes
- A cache or intermediate state

### Runner — Background World Processor

The Runner simulates the world in the background while the player experiences the journey.

- Spawned by Narrator as background bash task (`run_in_background=true`)
- Creates waypoint places (writes directly to graph)
- Ticks energy and pressure each segment
- Resolves tension breaks, creates narratives
- Outputs completion JSON via TaskOutput (NOT via hook)

**Key clarification:** Runner completion is read via `TaskOutput`, not hook injection. Hooks are for interruptions only.

### Narrator — Streaming Experience Layer

The Narrator owns the player experience. It streams, responds, and reacts.

- Spawns Runner with `bash(run_in_background=true)`
- Streams journey narration immediately (doesn't wait for Runner)
- Handles player conversation (input queue)
- Reads Runner output via `TaskOutput` when system reminder arrives
- Receives interruptions via PostToolUse hook

**Narrator reads:**
- Graph for current state
- TaskOutput for Runner completion
- Hook for mid-stream interruptions (character speaks, player UI)

### Frontend — Real-Time Visualization

The Frontend subscribes once and receives everything.

- Subscribes to graph SSE stream
- Updates map position in real-time
- Reveals fog on visibility changes
- Displays images when ready
- Writes to injection queue (player UI actions like stop button)

### Hook — Interruption Mechanism

Hooks are for interruptions ONLY. Not for Runner completion.

**Hook fires when:**
- A character in the player's group is activated via narrative
- Player uses UI (stop button, location click, portrait click)

**Hook does NOT fire for:**
- Runner completing a task (use TaskOutput)
- Normal state updates (use SSE)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why No Orchestrator in This Flow?

**In the async/travel flow:** No orchestrator. Narrator spawns Runner directly as a background Task(). The graph is the coordination point — components write to it, it emits events, others react.

**In other contexts:** The orchestrator still exists for non-travel scenarios (scene management, turn-based interactions, etc.). This async architecture is specifically for travel and background world simulation.

The current synchronous orchestrator creates:
- Single point of failure
- Complex state management
- Synchronous bottlenecks

The async architecture makes the **graph the coordinator** for real-time flows.

### Why TaskOutput for Runner Completion?

Runner is a long-running background task. When it completes, Narrator needs to know.

**Option rejected:** Hook injection
- Hooks are for interruptions (character speaks, player UI)
- Runner completion is not an interruption — it's expected

**Option chosen:** TaskOutput
- System sends reminder when background task has output
- Narrator calls `TaskOutput(task_id)` to read result
- Clean separation: TaskOutput for completion, Hook for interruptions

### Why SSE Instead of Polling?

The Frontend needs real-time updates during travel:
- Player position moves
- New places appear on map
- Images become ready
- Fog reveals

Polling would mean:
- Constant requests
- Delayed updates
- Wasted resources

SSE provides:
- Single connection
- Instant updates
- Efficient resource use

### Why Ephemeral Discussion Trees?

Companions need to feel alive. Pre-authored dialogue runs out.

**Solution:**
- Generate discussion trees in background (5-10 topics, 3-4 depth each)
- Delete branches when used
- Regenerate when branches < threshold
- Trees feel fresh, never repeat

## File Paths

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| Place images | `frontend/public/images/places/{place_id}.png` |
| Discussion trees | `playthroughs/default/discussion_trees/{char_id}.json` |
| Injection queue | `playthroughs/default/injection_queue.jsonl` |

---

## What Goes Where

| Component | Responsibilities |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Graph** | All persistent state, SSE emission, image generation trigger, character activation → injection queue |
| **Runner** | World simulation, place creation, energy ticking, break resolution, main output via TaskOutput |
| **Narrator** | Player experience, conversation, scene generation, journey narration, reads TaskOutput, receives hook interruptions |
| **Frontend** | Map rendering, fog of war, image display, real-time updates, player UI → injection queue |
| **Hook** | Character speaks (from graph activation), player UI actions (stop, click location) |

---

## Clarifications

### Multiple Runners

Multiple Runner instances can run simultaneously. Example: player traveling while characters move elsewhere in the world.

### Runner Robustness

Runner is assumed not to crash. No explicit failure handling in this architecture.

### Travel Interruption Position

If player aborts mid-travel, their position is the **last completed waypoint**. No interpolation.

### Narrator/Runner Timing

If Runner finishes before Narrator's journey narration completes, Narrator keeps streaming and incorporates the completion at the end. Runner completion doesn't interrupt the narrative flow.

### Player's Group Determination

Determined by `scene.json.characters` — array of character IDs present in the current scene. When a narrative activates a character in this list, injection fires.

### Idle Detection for Discussion Trees

Frontend responsibility. Frontend tracks time since last player input and triggers companion initiation after 10+ seconds of idle during travel.
