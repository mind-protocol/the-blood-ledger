# Repair Task

**Issue Type:** INCOMPLETE_IMPL
**Severity:** warning
**Target:** engine/infrastructure/api/playthroughs.py

## Instructions
## Task: Complete Empty Functions

**Target:** `engine/infrastructure/api/playthroughs.py`
**Problem:** Contains 2 empty/incomplete function(s)
**Empty functions:** ['_count_branches', 'create_scenario_playthrough']

## Steps:

1. Read the file and find empty functions (only have pass, docstring, or trivial body)
2. For each empty function:
   - Understand its purpose from name, docstring, and how it's called
   - Implement the logic
3. If a function should remain empty (abstract base, protocol), add a comment explaining why
4. Update SYNC with implementations added

## Success Criteria:
- Empty functions have real implementations
- Or have comments explaining why they're intentionally empty
- SYNC updated

Report "REPAIR COMPLETE" when done, or "REPAIR FAILED: <reason>" if you cannot complete.

MANDATORY FINAL LINE:
- End your response with a standalone line: `REPAIR COMPLETE`
- If you fail, end with: `REPAIR FAILED: <reason>`
